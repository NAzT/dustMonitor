# dustMonitor
Code base for my dust/CO2 meter. Currently waiting on parts before implementing dust PPM.

Currently supports graphing to the inbuilt LCD and via Bluetooth to the app.

Still under active development - WIP.

# Planned Features

1. BLE service to push live readings to a mobile app
2. SD Card option to save data to disk
3. Dust and VOC measurement
4. Cheaper version with mobile app only

Pull requests welcome!
