# dustMonitor
Code base for my dust/CO2 meter. Currently waiting on parts before implementing dust PPM.

Still under active development - WIP.

# Planned Features

1. BLE service to push live readings to a mobile app
2. WiFi and ThingSpeak to push data to the cloud
3. SD Card option to save data to disk
4. Dust and VOC measurement
5. Cheaper version with mobile app only

Pull requests welcome!
